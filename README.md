# Overview 
As one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, affects the health of millions of people and puts an enormous financial burden on the US economy. We aimed to develop predictive models to identify risk factors for type 2 diabetes, which could help facilitate early diagnosis and intervention and also reduce medical costs.
